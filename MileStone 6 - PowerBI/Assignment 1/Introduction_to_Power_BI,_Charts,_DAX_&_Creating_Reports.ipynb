        "\n",
        "- A Windows application used to build data models, reports, and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Offers data transformation using Power Query and data modeling using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).\n",

        "- A Pie Chart is a circular visual used in Power BI to display percentage contribution of each category to a whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each slice represents a category, and the size of the slice is proportional to its value.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pie charts are best used when you have limited categories (preferably 3–5) and when each category is visually distinct.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They are simple and widely used, but can become cluttered if too many slices exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Donut Chart, on the other hand, is a slightly modified version of a pie chart.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It contains a central hole, which makes the design cleaner and more modern.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Donut charts allow additional context to be displayed in the center, such as total sales, total profit, or any KPI value.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The readability of a donut chart is often considered better than a pie chart because the empty center focuses the viewer's attention on the relative proportions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When to Use Pie Chart\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A pie chart is useful when you want a quick understanding of the distribution among a small number of categories.\n",
        "\n",

        "  - Showing Sales Contribution of Four Regions (North, South, East, West) as percentages.\n",

        "- When to Use Donut Chart\n",

        "   - A donut chart is preferred when you want a cleaner look, show totals at the center, or compare more than four categories.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Displaying Profit Share by Product Category with Total Profit shown at the center.\n",
        "\n",
        "2️⃣ Bar Chart vs Column Chart\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Bar Chart represents data using horizontal bars. It is extremely useful when category names are long, or when the number of categories is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Since horizontal space is usually more than vertical space, bar charts are excellent for displaying many categories at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is one of the most readable visuals for making direct comparisons between items.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Column Chart represents data using vertical bars. Column charts are ideal when comparing values across time periods, such as years, months, or quarters.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Human eyes naturally follow vertical height to compare values, making column charts intuitive for trend-based analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Column charts work best when the number of categories is smaller and follow a natural sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When to Use Bar Chart\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use a bar chart when you have many categories or long text labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Comparing Sales across 12 Product Sub-Categories like “Office Supplies – Stationery” or “Furniture – Chairs”.\n",
        "\n",
