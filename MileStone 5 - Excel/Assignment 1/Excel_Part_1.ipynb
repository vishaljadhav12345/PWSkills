        "**5. Discuss the purpose of 'XLOOKUP' and how it differs from the traditional 'VLOOKUP' function.**\n",
        "\n",
        "XLOOKUP is a modern Excel lookup function designed to replace older lookup functions such as VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and even INDEX-MATCH. It is more powerful, flexible, and easier to use. XLOOKUP works in both vertical and horizontal directions and eliminates many limitations found in VLOOKUP.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Purpose of XLOOKUP\n",
        "\n",
        "- The purpose of XLOOKUP is to search for a value in a range (lookup array) and return a corresponding value from another range (return array).\n",
        "\n",
        "- It simplifies data retrieval tasks and provides more reliable, flexible lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Look up values both vertically and horizontally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Return exact matches by default (unlike VLOOKUP).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Search from top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Return entire rows or columns (multiple values).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Handle missing values using custom error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Syntax of XLOOKUP\n",
        "\n",
        "- =XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning:\n",
        "\n",
        "- lookup_value: value to find\n",
        "\n",
        "- lookup_array: column/row to search\n",
        "\n",
        "- return_array: value to return from another column/row\n",
        "\n",
        "- Optional modes give flexibility (error handling, match type, search method)\n",
        "\n",
        "3.How XLOOKUP Differs from VLOOKUP\n",
        "\n",
        "- XLOOKUP is a significant improvement over VLOOKUP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Major differences are listed below:\n",
        "\n",
        "A. Direction of Lookup\n",
        "VLOOKUP:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Only searches vertically.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can return values only from the right side of the lookup column.\n",

        "XLOOKUP:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Works both vertically and horizontally (like VLOOKUP + HLOOKUP combined).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can return values from left or right, removing VLOOKUP’s major limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Return a value from a column left of the lookup column — Not possible with VLOOKUP, but easy with XLOOKUP.\n",
        "\n",
        "B. No Need for Column Index Numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "VLOOKUP:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Requires a column number (e.g., 2 or 3) as the return index.\n",

        "\n",
        "XLOOKUP:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Directly references the return column.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Rearranging columns does not break the formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "C. Exact Match vs Approximate Match\n",
        "\n",
        "VLOOKUP:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Uses approximate match by default, which often causes incorrect results unless the user adds FALSE.\n",

        "- Uses exact match by default, reducing mistakes.\n",

        "\n",
