        "\n",
        "Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement in SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is defined using the WITH keyword and acts like a temporary view that exists only for the duration of the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "- CTEs help in breaking down complex queries into smaller, more readable parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "- The query inside the parentheses creates a temporary result set.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This result set can then be referenced multiple times in the main query that follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It improves readability, modularity, and maintainability of SQL code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main Benefits of CTEs\n",
        "\n",
        "1️⃣ Readability and Simplicity\n",
        "\n",
        "- CTEs make complex queries easier to read by breaking them into smaller, logical sections instead of nesting multiple subqueries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2️⃣ Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can reference the same CTE multiple times within the same query, eliminating repetition and improving efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3️⃣ Recursive Queries\n",
        "\n",
        "- CTEs can be recursive, allowing you to query hierarchical or tree-structured data (like organizational charts or category trees).\n",
        "\n",
        "4️⃣ Temporary Scope\n",
        "\n",
        "- A CTE exists only during the execution of a single query.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It does not create a permanent table or view in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Example (Non-Recursive CTE)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Suppose we have a table Employees with columns: EmpID, EmpName, Dept, and Salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We want to find employees earning above the average salary in their department.\n",
